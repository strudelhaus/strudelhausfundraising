# Strudel Haus

Full-stack application that facilitates online fundraising sales, tracks detailed fundraising sales data, and streamlines the entire fundraising process.  There will be three types of users who interact with this application: Administrator, Organization Leader, and Customer. The Administrator (Thomas Ruhland) will be able to create and manage organizations, fundraising campaigns and strudel products, and will be able to view their current production pipeline based on campaign dates. An Organization leader will be able to manage all orders for each campaign tied to their organization, as well as access current sales data for each campaign. Finally, a Customer will be able to purchase strudels via our fundraising sales portal (driven by Square).
